# Baldwin Writer: Agent Transformation Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for transforming BMAD-METHOD software development agents into Baldwin Writer content creation agents. The transformation maintains the core BMAD framework while adapting all terminology, personas, and workflows for content creation.

## Transformation Philosophy

### Core Principle
**Maintain the structure, transform the domain**

The BMAD agent architecture is sound‚Äîit's the software development domain that needs to change. We keep:
- ‚úÖ Agent file structure and YAML schema
- ‚úÖ Activation instructions and persona system
- ‚úÖ Command system with `*` prefix
- ‚úÖ Dependencies and task execution model

We transform:
- üîÑ Agent names and identities
- üîÑ Persona descriptions and expertise
- üîÑ Commands and their purposes
- üîÑ Core principles and focus areas
- üîÑ Referenced tasks, templates, and checklists

## Step-by-Step Transformation Process

### Phase 1: Preparation

1. **Backup Original Files**
   ```bash
   cp -r bmad-core/agents bmad-core/agents-backup-bmad
   ```

2. **Review Terminology Guide**
   - Read [TERMINOLOGY.md](TERMINOLOGY.md) completely
   - Understand all terminology mappings
   - Keep it open for reference

3. **Create Transformation Checklist**
   - [ ] Agent file renamed
   - [ ] Agent identity updated
   - [ ] Persona transformed
   - [ ] Core principles adapted
   - [ ] Commands updated
   - [ ] Dependencies mapped
   - [ ] Startup context rewritten
   - [ ] Comments updated
   - [ ] Examples changed

### Phase 2: File-Level Transformation

For each agent file:

#### Step 1: Rename File
```bash
cd bmad-core/agents
mv analyst.md content-strategist.md
```

#### Step 2: Update Header Comment
```markdown
# BEFORE
<!-- Powered by BMAD‚Ñ¢ Core -->

# AFTER
<!-- Powered by Baldwin Writer‚Ñ¢ -->
```

#### Step 3: Update Agent ID and Name
```yaml
# Find and replace in YAML block
id: analyst ‚Üí id: content-strategist
```

#### Step 4: Transform Persona
Using the transformation matrix above, rewrite:
- `role`: Change domain from software to content
- `style`: Adapt if needed (usually stays similar)
- `identity`: Reframe expertise for content creation
- `focus`: Shift objectives to content domain

#### Step 5: Update Core Principles
For each principle:
1. Identify the underlying pattern
2. Keep the pattern, change the domain
3. Replace dev terms with content terms

Example:
```yaml
# Pattern: Don't assume, verify
BEFORE: "Requirements come from understanding, not assumptions"
AFTER: "Content strategy comes from understanding, not assumptions"

# Pattern: Check before acting
BEFORE: "ALWAYS check current folder structure before starting"
AFTER: "ALWAYS review existing content before starting new sections"
```

#### Step 6: Transform Commands
For each command:
1. Rename command if needed (keep `*` prefix)
2. Update description
3. Change referenced tasks/templates
4. Maintain same command structure

#### Step 7: Map Dependencies
For each dependency:
1. Check if equivalent exists (e.g., `create-doc.md` stays the same)
2. Map to content equivalent (e.g., `prd-tmpl.yaml` ‚Üí `content-brief-tmpl.yaml`)
3. Create new dependency if needed

#### Step 8: Rewrite Startup Context
If the agent has a "Startup Context" section after the YAML:
1. Keep the structure (introductory paragraph + bullet points)
2. Change domain from software to content
3. Update mental models and frameworks
4. Maintain the depth and detail

Example:
```markdown
# BEFORE
You are the Architect, a master of system design. Your expertise spans microservices,
monoliths, distributed systems, and cloud architecture.

Think in terms of:
- **Scalability** that handles growth
- **Maintainability** that eases changes
- **Performance** that satisfies users

# AFTER
You are the Content Architect, a master of information design. Your expertise spans
long-form content, article series, documentation structures, and content hierarchies.

Think in terms of:
- **Readability** that aids comprehension
- **Maintainability** that eases updates
- **Engagement** that satisfies readers
```

### Phase 3: Dependency Transformation

#### Step 1: Map Templates
Create content equivalents for each template:

```yaml
# Core template mappings
project-brief-tmpl.yaml ‚Üí content-brief-tmpl.yaml
prd-tmpl.yaml ‚Üí content-brief-tmpl.yaml
architecture-tmpl.yaml ‚Üí content-architecture-tmpl.yaml
story-tmpl.yaml ‚Üí content-piece-tmpl.yaml
technical-spec-tmpl.yaml ‚Üí content-specification-tmpl.yaml
```

#### Step 2: Map Tasks
Update task references:

```yaml
# Core task mappings
create-next-story.md ‚Üí create-content-piece.md
validate-next-story.md ‚Üí validate-content-piece.md
review-story.md ‚Üí review-content.md
apply-qa-fixes.md ‚Üí apply-editorial-fixes.md
```

#### Step 3: Map Checklists
Transform checklist references:

```yaml
# Core checklist mappings
story-dod-checklist.md ‚Üí publishing-checklist.md
architect-checklist.md ‚Üí content-architecture-checklist.md
pm-checklist.md ‚Üí editorial-pm-checklist.md
```

#### Step 4: Map Data Files
Update knowledge base references:

```yaml
# Core data mappings
bmad-kb.md ‚Üí baldwin-kb.md
technical-preferences.md ‚Üí writing-preferences.md
brainstorming-techniques.md ‚Üí brainstorming-techniques.md (same)
elicitation-methods.md ‚Üí content-research-methods.md
```

### Phase 4: Content Creation

After transforming agents, create the referenced dependencies:

#### Templates to Create
1. **content-brief-tmpl.yaml** - Content requirements document
2. **content-architecture-tmpl.yaml** - Content structure blueprint
3. **content-piece-tmpl.yaml** - Individual content deliverable
4. **outline-tmpl.yaml** - Content outline
5. **style-guide-tmpl.yaml** - Writing style guidelines

#### Tasks to Create
1. **create-content-piece.md** - Generate new content
2. **review-content.md** - Editorial review process
3. **validate-content-piece.md** - Quality validation
4. **apply-editorial-fixes.md** - Apply review feedback
5. **audience-research.md** - Audience analysis
6. **content-gap-analysis.md** - Identify missing content

#### Checklists to Create
1. **publishing-checklist.md** - Pre-publication requirements
2. **content-architecture-checklist.md** - Structure review
3. **editorial-pm-checklist.md** - PM quality standards
4. **brand-consistency-checklist.md** - Voice/style check

#### Data Files to Create
1. **baldwin-kb.md** - Baldwin Writer knowledge base
2. **writing-preferences.md** - User writing preferences
3. **content-research-methods.md** - Research techniques
4. **content-structures.md** - Common content patterns
5. **audience-personas.md** - Reader archetypes

### Phase 5: Validation

#### Checklist for Each Transformed Agent

```markdown
- [ ] File renamed correctly
- [ ] All BMAD‚Ñ¢ references changed to Baldwin Writer‚Ñ¢
- [ ] Agent ID updated throughout file
- [ ] Agent name and title transformed
- [ ] Icon appropriate for content domain
- [ ] whenToUse describes content use case
- [ ] Persona role adapted to content creation
- [ ] Persona identity reframed
- [ ] All core principles transformed
- [ ] All commands renamed and updated
- [ ] All command descriptions use content terminology
- [ ] All dependencies exist or are planned
- [ ] Startup context rewritten for content domain
- [ ] No software development terminology remains
- [ ] File reads naturally in content context
- [ ] Examples (if any) use content scenarios
```

#### Integration Testing

1. **Load Agent Test**
   - Verify agent loads without errors
   - Check all dependencies resolve
   - Confirm commands work

2. **Workflow Test**
   - Run a simple workflow
   - Verify agent interactions
   - Check output quality

3. **Terminology Audit**
   - Search for dev terms (code, test, deploy, etc.)
   - Replace any remaining software terminology
   - Verify consistency with TERMINOLOGY.md

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Incomplete Terminology Transformation
**Problem**: Some dev terms slip through
**Solution**: Use search for common dev terms
```bash
# Search for common dev terminology
grep -r "code\|deploy\|test\|bug\|feature" bmad-core/agents/
```

### Pitfall 2: Mixed Metaphors
**Problem**: Mixing dev and content terminology
**Solution**: Stick to one domain per file completely

### Pitfall 3: Broken Dependencies
**Problem**: Referencing non-existent content files
**Solution**: Create dependency files or use existing generic ones

### Pitfall 4: Lost Meaning in Translation
**Problem**: Transformation loses the original intent
**Solution**: Keep the pattern/principle, change only the domain

### Pitfall 5: Over-Complication
**Problem**: Adding unnecessary content-specific complexity
**Solution**: Keep it as simple as the original

## Automation Tools

### Search & Replace Patterns

```bash
# Basic terminology replacement
sed -i '' 's/story/content piece/g' filename.md
sed -i '' 's/developer/writer/g' filename.md
sed -i '' 's/code/content/g' filename.md

# Be careful with these - verify each change!
```

### Validation Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# validate-agent.sh - Check agent transformation

AGENT_FILE=$1

echo "Validating $AGENT_FILE..."

# Check for BMAD references
if grep -q "BMAD‚Ñ¢ Core" "$AGENT_FILE"; then
    echo "‚ùå Still references BMAD‚Ñ¢ Core"
fi

# Check for dev terminology
DEV_TERMS="code|deploy|test case|bug|feature|repository"
if grep -qE "$DEV_TERMS" "$AGENT_FILE"; then
    echo "‚ùå Contains dev terminology"
    grep -nE "$DEV_TERMS" "$AGENT_FILE"
fi

# Check for proper agent ID
if ! grep -q "id: content-\|id: writer\|id: editorial-\|id: baldwin-" "$AGENT_FILE"; then
    echo "‚ùå Agent ID not transformed"
fi

echo "‚úÖ Validation complete"
```

## Post-Transformation Tasks

### 1. Update Build System
Ensure build tools recognize new agent names:
```json
// package.json
{
  "bin": {
    "baldwin": "tools/bmad-npx-wrapper.js",
    "baldwin-writer": "tools/bmad-npx-wrapper.js"
  }
}
```

### 2. Update Team Configurations
Transform team files in `bmad-core/agent-teams/`:
```yaml

  name: Core Writing Team
  agents:
    - content-strategist
    - content-architect
    - writer
    - copy-editor
    - content-sprint-lead
```

### 3. Update Workflows
Transform workflows in `bmad-core/workflows/` to reference new agents

### 4. Update Documentation
