# Topic Validation Guide

## Overview

Topic validation is the process of determining whether a content idea is worth pursuing before investing time and resources. This guide provides frameworks and methods to systematically validate topic opportunities.

## Why Validate Topics?

### The Cost of Wrong Topics

**Without Validation**:

- Waste weeks creating content nobody reads
- Miss high-opportunity topics
- Compete where you can't win
- Create content that doesn't support business goals
- Spend resources on low-ROI topics

**With Validation**:

- Confirm audience demand before writing
- Identify winnable opportunities
- Align content with business objectives
- Prioritize high-impact topics
- Invest resources strategically

### Validation Philosophy

**Principles**:

- **Data-driven**: Use research, not assumptions
- **Systematic**: Follow repeatable process
- **Honest**: Accept when topics don't work
- **Strategic**: Consider business fit
- **Practical**: Balance ideal vs. achievable

## The 5-Point Validation Framework

### 1. Demand Validation

**Question**: Do people actually want this content?

#### Search Volume Analysis

**Using SEO Tools** (Ahrefs, Semrush, Moz):

```
Topic: "API testing best practices"

Primary Keyword Research:
- "API testing best practices" - 720/month
- "API testing tutorial" - 1,600/month
- "how to test APIs" - 880/month
- "REST API testing" - 2,900/month

Total search demand: ~6,100/month ✅

Verdict: STRONG DEMAND
```

**Volume Benchmarks**:

- **High**: 5,000+ monthly searches
- **Medium**: 1,000-5,000 monthly searches
- **Low**: 100-1,000 monthly searches
- **Niche**: <100 monthly searches

**Important**: Low volume + high intent can still be valuable

**Example** (Tech):

```
Topic: "Kubernetes cost optimization strategies"
- Primary keyword: 210/month
- Related keywords: ~400/month total
- Volume: LOW

But:
- Average deal size: $50K-200K
- Technical decision-makers searching
- High commercial intent
- Few quality resources

Verdict: PURSUE (high-value niche) ✅
```

#### Trend Analysis

**Google Trends**:

```
Check:
1. Is interest growing or declining?
2. Seasonal patterns?
3. Geographic interest?
4. Related topics trending?

Example: "microservices architecture"
- Trend: Growing (+15% year over year)
- Seasonality: None (consistent)
- Peak interest: Developer hubs (SF, Seattle, Austin)

Verdict: GROWING TOPIC ✅
```

**Red Flags**:

- Declining trend over 12+ months
- One-time spike (fad topic)
- Highly seasonal (unless intentional)
- Replaced by newer terminology

#### Beyond Search Volume

**Community Interest**:

Check these sources for demand signals:

**Reddit**:

```
Search: "kubernetes" in r/devops
- 450 posts in last month
- Average 25 comments per post
- Active discussions
- Repeated questions

Demand Signal: STRONG ✅
```

**Stack Overflow**:

```
Tag: "docker"
- 450,000 questions
- 2,000+ new questions/month
- High answer rate
- Active community

Demand Signal: STRONG ✅
```

**Community Demand Signals**:

- Frequent questions about topic
- High engagement on related posts
- Multiple communities discussing
- Customer support mentions
- Sales team hears about it

#### Demand Validation Checklist

- [ ] Primary keyword has 100+ monthly searches OR
- [ ] Combined related keywords have 500+ monthly searches OR
- [ ] High commercial intent with qualified audience OR
- [ ] Strong community interest and discussion OR
- [ ] Frequent customer/prospect questions

**Minimum Threshold**: At least 2 of the above
