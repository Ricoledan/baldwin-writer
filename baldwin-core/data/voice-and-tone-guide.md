# Voice and Tone Guide

## Overview

Voice and tone are fundamental to consistent, effective content. This guide explains the difference between them and how to define and apply each for maximum impact.

## Voice vs. Tone

### Voice

**Definition**: Your brand's personality—who you are as an organization

**Characteristics**:

- Consistent across all content
- Reflects brand values and culture
- Defines your unique personality
- Stays the same regardless of context
- What makes you sound like "you"

**Example**:
A tech startup might have a voice that's:

- Innovative
- Friendly
- Accessible
- Bold
- Human

### Tone

**Definition**: How you express your voice in specific situations

**Characteristics**:

- Adapts to context and audience
- Changes based on content type
- Responds to reader emotions
- Adjusts for subject matter
- How voice sounds in different moments

**Example**:
That same startup's tone might be:

- Excited (product launch)
- Empathetic (support documentation)
- Professional (security update)
- Playful (social media)
- Serious (terms of service)

### The Analogy

**Voice** = Your personality
**Tone** = How that personality expresses itself in different situations

Just as you're always yourself, but you speak differently at a party vs. a funeral, your brand voice stays constant while tone adapts.

## Testing and Refining Voice

### The Voice Consistency Test

Take 3-5 pieces of your content and ask:

1. **Recognition**: Could you tell they're from the same brand?
2. **Distinction**: Do they sound different from competitors?
3. **Consistency**: Do they share common characteristics?
4. **Alignment**: Do they reflect your stated voice?
5. **Effectiveness**: Do they connect with your audience?

### Reader Feedback

Ask readers:

- What 3 words describe our voice?
- How would you describe our personality?
- What makes our content different?
- When do we sound most like ourselves?
- When do we sound off-brand?

### Competitive Analysis

Compare your voice to competitors:

- How are you different?
- What's your unique position?

## Voice Evolution

### When to Update Voice

Voice should be stable but can evolve when:

- **Company growth**: Startup → Enterprise
- **Audience shift**: Different primary audience
- **Market changes**: Industry evolution
- **Brand refresh**: Intentional repositioning
- **Feedback indicates**: Current voice isn't working

### How to Evolve Voice

1. **Audit Current State**: Document how voice is used now
2. **Define Desired State**: Articulate target voice
3. **Identify Gaps**: What needs to change
4. **Plan Transition**: Gradual shift vs. sudden change
5. **Update Guidelines**: Revise voice documentation
6. **Train Team**: Ensure everyone understands changes
7. **Implement**: Start using new voice
8. **Review & Refine**: Gather feedback and adjust

### Voice vs. Trend

**Don't chase trends**:

- Slang and memes date quickly
- Viral formats lose relevance
- Trendy language feels forced
- Authenticity suffers

**Do stay current**:

- Understand cultural context
- Use contemporary examples
- Acknowledge current events (when relevant)
- Sound like a real person
