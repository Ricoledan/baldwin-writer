- Shorter: 3-5 minutes works well
- Longer: 10+ minutes possible but harder
- Medium shows estimated read time

**Publishing Frequency**:

- Quality over quantity
- 1-3 posts per week sustainable
- Daily possible if high quality
- Inconsistency okay (discovery-driven)

### SEO & Discoverability

**SEO Considerations**:

- ✅ Strong Google indexing
- ✅ Custom URLs (edit before publishing)
- ✅ Meta descriptions (subtitle)
- ⚠️ Canonical URLs (use for republished content)
- ⚠️ Duplicate content issues if republishing

**SEO Best Practices**:

1. **Custom URL**: Edit before first publish
   - Click "Change" on story URL
   - Use target keyword
   - Keep short and descriptive
   - Can't change after publishing

2. **Canonical Links**: For republished content
   - Settings → Advanced → Canonical link
   - Points to original source
   - Avoids duplicate content penalty
   - Use when republishing from your blog

3. **Subtitle**: Acts as meta description
   - Appears in Google results
   - 140 characters or less
   - Include target keyword
   - Compelling hook

4. **Tags**: Choose 5 relevant tags

**Implications**:

- Treat Medium as top-of-funnel
- Drive readers to owned channels (newsletter, website)
- Include CTA to Substack/email list
- Use for brand building, not audience building

### Monetization

**Medium Partner Program**:

- Must apply and be accepted
- Requires 100 followers
- Payment based on member reading time
- Earnings per article vary widely
- Typical: $10-500 per article
- Top writers: $1,000-10,000+/month

**Economics**:

- Readers pay $5/month or $50/year
- Medium distributes to writers
- Based on reading time by members
- Non-members can read some free articles
- You choose: free or members-only

**Strategy**:

- Make some content free (discovery)

## Multi-Platform Strategy

### Owned vs. Rented Platforms

**Owned Platforms** (You control):

- Your website/blog (WordPress, Ghost, custom)
- Substack (you own email list)
- Self-hosted Ghost

**Rented Platforms** (Platform controls):

- Medium
- LinkedIn
- Dev.to
- Hashnode (hybrid - you own domain)

### Recommended Multi-Platform Approach

**Tier 1: Home Base (Owned)**

- Primary: Your website OR Substack
- Full control over audience
- Email list ownership
- Long-term asset

**Tier 2: Amplification (Rented)**

- Medium (for discovery)
- LinkedIn (for professional reach)
- Dev.to (for developer content)

**Strategy**:

1. Publish to home base first
2. Wait 1-2 weeks for SEO
3. Republish to amplification platforms with canonical links
4. Drive traffic back to owned platform
5. Convert readers to email subscribers

### Cross-Posting Best Practices

**When to Cross-Post**:

- ✅ Content is evergreen
- ✅ You want maximum reach
- ✅ After original has been indexed (1-2 weeks)
- ✅ Using canonical links properly

**How to Cross-Post Safely**:

1. Publish on your owned platform first
2. Wait for Google indexing (check Search Console)
3. Add canonical link on republished version
4. Modify introduction slightly
5. Add CTA pointing to your owned platform

**Canonical Link Setup**:

- Medium: Settings → Advanced → Canonical URL
- Dev.to: canonical_url in frontmatter
- LinkedIn: No canonical support (be careful)
- Hashnode: Canonical URL field
