## Targeting Multiple Personas

### Layered Content Approach

When writing for multiple personas:

1. **Lead with the Hook**: Appeal to broadest audience first
2. **Layer Complexity**: Start simple, go deeper progressively
3. **Use Sectioning**: Let readers jump to their level
4. **Provide Alternatives**: Offer both summaries and details
5. **Clear Navigation**: Help readers find what they need

### Example Structure

```
# Engaging Headline (everyone)

## TL;DR (executives, busy browsers)
Quick summary with key takeaways

## Introduction (general audience)
Accessible overview of the topic

## Core Content (practitioners, learners)
Detailed explanation and examples

## Advanced Topics (experts)
Edge cases, technical depth

## Practical Application (decision makers, practitioners)
How to implement

## Further Reading (learners, experts)
Deep dives and resources
```

## Persona Selection Framework

### Questions to Ask

1. **Who Benefits Most**: Who gains most from this content?
2. **Who Has Authority**: Who can act on this information?
3. **Who Searches for This**: Who actively seeks this content?
4. **Who Shares Content**: Who will amplify this piece?

### Prioritization

**Primary Persona** (70% of content):

- Main target audience
