# Content Gap Analysis Guide

## Overview

Content gap analysis is the systematic process of identifying valuable content opportunities by finding topics your audience searches for that you haven't covered, or where competitors have stronger content. This guide provides step-by-step methods for discovering and prioritizing content gaps.

## What Are Content Gaps?

### Types of Content Gaps

#### 1. Keyword Gap

**Definition**: Keywords and search terms that competitors rank for, but you don't.

**Example**:

```
Your competitor ranks for:
- "API rate limiting" (position 3, 1,200/month)
- "API versioning best practices" (position 2, 800/month)
- "REST API pagination" (position 4, 600/month)

You rank for:
- None of these

Gap: 3 keyword opportunities, ~2,600 monthly searches
```

#### 2. Topic Gap

**Definition**: Subject areas or themes you haven't covered at all.

**Example**:

```
Your Content Coverage:
✅ API design basics
✅ API security
❌ API performance optimization (GAP)
❌ API versioning strategies (GAP)
❌ API documentation (GAP)
✅ API testing

Gaps: 3 major topic areas missing
```

#### 3. Quality Gap

**Definition**: Topics where you have content, but competitors' content is significantly better.

**Example**:

```
Topic: "API authentication methods"

Your article:
- 800 words
- Published 2021
- 3 methods covered
- No code examples
- 2 backlinks

Competitor article:
- 3,200 words
- Published 2024
- 7 methods covered
- 15 code examples
- 47 backlinks

Gap: Quality and comprehensiveness
Action: Update/rewrite
```

#### 4. Format Gap

**Definition**: Content types or formats you're missing.

**Example**:

```
Content Formats:

Your formats:
✅ Blog articles (50)
✅ How-to guides (15)
❌ Video tutorials (GAP)
❌ Interactive tools (GAP)
❌ Downloadable templates (GAP)
❌ Webinars (GAP)

Gaps: 4 format types competitors use successfully
```

#### 5. Audience Segment Gap

**Definition**: Audience segments not adequately served by your content.

**Example**:

```
Target Audiences:

Content coverage:
✅ Beginner developers (30% of content)
✅ Intermediate developers (50% of content)
❌ Enterprise CTOs (GAP - 5% of content)
❌ API product managers (GAP - 2% of content)

Gaps: Under-serving senior/decision-maker audiences
```

#### 6. Search Intent Gap

**Definition**: Missing content for specific search intents.

**Example**:

```
Search Intent Coverage:

Your content:
- Informational: 70% ✅
- Navigational: 20% ✅
- Commercial: 5% ❌ (GAP)
- Transactional: 5% ❌ (GAP)

Gaps: Under-serving commercial and transactional intent
Need: Comparison guides, alternatives pages, decision content
```

## Step-by-Step Gap Analysis Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Content Inventory

**Create comprehensive list of all your content**:

```markdown
## Content Inventory

### Blog Articles (47)

1. "Introduction to REST APIs" (1,200 words, 2022-03-15)
2. "API Authentication Best Practices" (1,800 words, 2023-06-20)
3. "Building Your First API" (2,100 words, 2023-09-10)
   ...

### Resources (8)

1. "API Design Checklist" (template, 2023-01-15)
2. "REST API Best Practices Guide" (PDF, 2022-08-20)
   ...

### Videos (0)

- None

### Tools (0)

- None
```

**Extract metadata**:

```
For each piece:
- Title
- URL
- Primary keyword
- Related keywords
- Word count
- Publish date
- Last updated
- Current rankings (if any)
- Traffic (monthly)
```

**Export from Google Analytics / Search Console**:

- All ranking keywords (position 1-100)
- Traffic by page
- Top performing content

### Step 2: Identify Your Competitors

**Competitor Types**:

**Direct Competitors** (Same business/product):

- Targeting same customers
- Similar positioning
- Same market

**Content Competitors** (Targeting same keywords):

- Ranking for your target keywords
- May be different business
- Focus: Their content, not product

**How to Find Content Competitors**:

**Method 1: Google Search**:

```
1. Search your top 10 target keywords
2. Note who appears in top 10 repeatedly
3. List competitors by frequency

Example:
"API documentation" → ReadMe, Stoplight, Swagger
"API testing" → Postman, SoapUI, RestAssured
"API design" → Nordic APIs, Phil Sturgeon, Swagger

Content Competitors:
- Swagger (appears 3x)
- Postman (appears 2x)
- ReadMe (appears 2x)
- Nordic APIs (appears 1x)
```

**Method 2: Ahrefs "Competing Domains"**:

```
1. Ahrefs → Site Explorer → Your domain
2. Organic Search → Competitors
3. Filter by "Common keywords" > 50
4. Review top 10 domains

Result: Competitors with significant keyword overlap
```

**Select 3-5 Competitors for Analysis**:

```
Chosen Competitors:
1. Postman Blog (Direct competitor, strong content)
2. Nordic APIs (Thought leader, API-focused)
3. RapidAPI Blog (Similar audience, comprehensive)
4. Kong Blog (Enterprise focus, high authority)
5. RestfulAPI.net (Niche authority, specific topics)

Why these:
- Mix of business types
- Varying domain authority
- Different content strategies
- Cover different angles
```

```
5 points: >5,000 monthly search volume
4 points: 1,000-5,000 monthly volume
3 points: 500-1,000 monthly volume
2 points: 100-500 monthly volume
1 point: <100 but high intent
```

#### 2. Competition Level (1-5 points)

```
5 points: Weak competition (DA <40, thin content)
4 points: Medium-low competition (DA 40-55)
3 points: Medium competition (DA 55-65)
2 points: Strong competition (DA 65-75)
1 point: Very strong (DA 75+)
```

#### 3. Business Value (1-5 points)

```
5 points: Direct conversion impact
4 points: Strong lead generation
3 points: Moderate business alignment
2 points: Indirect benefit
1 point: Weak alignment
```

#### 4. Effort Required (1-5 points)

```
5 points: Easy (simple article, <8 hours)
4 points: Moderate (standard article, 8-12 hours)
3 points: Complex (comprehensive guide, 16-20 hours)
2 points: Very complex (research needed, 24+ hours)
1 point: Extremely complex (>40 hours)
```

### Priority Calculation

**Total Score** = Opportunity + (6 - Competition) + Business Value + Effort

Why "(6 - Competition)"?: Lower competition = higher priority

- **15-17 points**: HIGH (next sprint)
- **12-14 points**: MEDIUM (plan for next quarter)
- **9-11 points**: LOW (backlog)
- **<9 points**: DEFER or skip

### Example Prioritization

```markdown
## Gap: "API Authentication Methods Complete Guide"

### Scoring

**Opportunity**: 4/5

- Search volume: 1,800/month
- Multiple related keywords: +1,200/month
- Total: ~3,000/month

**Competition**: 3 → Score 3/5 (6-3=3)

- Medium competition
- Top results: DA 55-70
- Can compete with quality

**Business Value**: 5/5

- Core to our product (API platform)
- High conversion topic
- Attracts qualified leads

**Effort**: 4/5

- Moderate complexity
- Estimated: 12 hours
- Have internal expertise

**Total**: 4 + 3 + 5 + 4 = 16/20

**Priority**: HIGH ✅
**Action**: Schedule for next sprint
