# Topic Research Framework

## Overview

Topic research is the foundation of effective content creation. This framework provides systematic methods for discovering, validating, and prioritizing content topics that resonate with your audience and achieve your business goals.

## Philosophy

### Research-Driven Content Creation

**Principles**:

- **Data over intuition**: Use research to validate topic ideas
- **Audience-first**: Topics should solve real audience problems
- **Competition-aware**: Understand the content landscape
- **Strategic alignment**: Topics should support business goals
- **Systematic approach**: Follow repeatable processes

### Why Topic Research Matters

**Without Research**:

- Writing content nobody searches for
- Missing high-opportunity topics
- Creating content that already exists
- Wasting time on low-value topics
- Guessing what audiences want

**With Research**:

- Targeting proven audience needs
- Finding content gaps and opportunities
- Creating differentiated content
- Prioritizing high-impact topics
- Knowing what will perform

## The BADVC Framework

### Overview

**BADVC** stands for **Breadth**, **Authority**, **Depth**, **Volume**, and **Competition**. This framework helps evaluate topic opportunities comprehensively.

### B - Breadth

**Definition**: The range and scope of content you can create around a topic

**Questions to Ask**:

- Can this topic support multiple pieces of content?
- Are there subtopics to explore?
- Can I build a topic cluster around this?
- Is there enough material for a content series?

**How to Assess**:

```
Topic: "Content Marketing Strategy"

Breadth Assessment:
- Main topic: Content strategy fundamentals
- Subtopics: Planning, creation, distribution, measurement
- Related topics: SEO strategy, social media, email marketing
- Formats: Guides, tutorials, templates, checklists
- Audiences: Beginners, managers, executives

Breadth Score: HIGH ✅
```

**Red Flags**:

- Topic is too narrow to expand
- One-and-done content with no follow-up
- Limited audience interest beyond single article

### A - Authority

**Definition**: Your existing expertise and credibility in the topic area

**Questions to Ask**:

- Do we have expertise in this area?
- Can we provide unique insights?
- Will readers trust us on this topic?
- Do we have proof points (case studies, results)?

**How to Assess**:

```
Topic: "B2B SaaS Pricing Strategies"

Authority Assessment:
- Team expertise: 5 years SaaS experience ✅
- Case studies: 3 clients with pricing success ✅
- Unique data: Survey of 200 SaaS companies ✅
- Credentials: Pricing certified team member ✅

Authority Score: HIGH ✅
```

**Building Authority**:

- Original research and data
- Case studies and examples
- Expert interviews
- Practical experience
- Unique frameworks or methodologies

**Red Flags**:

- No subject matter expertise
- Can't add unique value
- Many established authorities already
- Would need to hire external experts

### D - Depth

**Definition**: The level of detail and comprehensiveness needed

**Questions to Ask**:

- What depth do readers need?
- Are current resources shallow or comprehensive?
- Can we go deeper than competitors?
- Is there opportunity for authoritative depth?

**How to Assess**:

```
Topic: "Email Marketing Automation"

Depth Assessment:
- Existing content: Mostly beginner-level
- Opportunity: Advanced automation strategies
- Audience need: Implementation details lacking
- Competitive gap: No comprehensive guides

Depth Score: MEDIUM-HIGH ✅
Opportunity: Go deeper than existing content
```

**Depth Levels**:

- **Surface** (100-300 words): Quick tips, definitions
- **Moderate** (500-1,000 words): How-to guides, explanations
- **Deep** (1,500-3,000 words): Comprehensive guides, tutorials
- **Authoritative** (3,000+ words): Ultimate guides, research

**Red Flags**:

- Topic too complex for audience
- Depth doesn't match search intent
- Can't provide more depth than competitors

### V - Volume

**Definition**: Search demand and audience interest in the topic

**Questions to Ask**:

- How many people search for this?
- Is search volume trending up or down?
- Are people asking about this in communities?
- Does this align with audience pain points?

**How to Assess Volume**:

**Search Volume**:

```
Keyword: "content calendar template"
- Monthly searches: 5,400
- Trend: Growing (+15% YoY)
- Related searches: 20+ variations
- Question volume: 50+ PAA questions

Volume Score: HIGH ✅
```

**Beyond Search Volume**:

- Social media discussions
- Forum and community questions
- Customer support questions
- Sales objections and questions
- Industry trends and news

**Volume Tiers**:

- **High**: 10,000+ monthly searches
- **Medium**: 1,000-10,000 monthly searches
- **Low**: 100-1,000 monthly searches
- **Niche**: <100 monthly searches (but high intent)

**Important**: Low volume + high intent can be valuable (e.g., "enterprise content management RFP template")

### C - Competition

**Definition**: How difficult it will be to rank and get attention for this topic

**Questions to Ask**:

- Who else is covering this topic?
- What's the quality of existing content?
- Can we create something better?
- What's our domain authority vs. competitors?

**How to Assess Competition**:

**Competitive Landscape**:

```
Topic: "Content Strategy Framework"

Competition Analysis:
- Top 10 results: 8 established brands
- Domain authority: 60-80 (ours: 35)
- Content quality: Comprehensive guides
- Publish dates: Mostly 2023-2024
- Unique angles: Limited differentiation

Competition Score: HIGH ⚠️
Strategy: Need unique angle or superior depth
```

**Competition Levels**:

- **Low**: Few quality resources, weak competitors
- **Medium**: Some quality content, mixed authority
- **High**: Many authoritative resources, strong competitors
- **Very High**: Dominated by major brands, recent comprehensive content

**Strategies by Competition Level**:

**Low Competition**:

- Create comprehensive resource

**Medium Competition**:

- Find unique angle or perspective
- Go deeper than existing content
- Target long-tail variations

**High Competition**:

- Create distinctly better content (10x content)
- Find underserved subtopics
- Target specific audience segments
- Build from related topics first

**Very High Competition**:

- Build authority in adjacent topics first

### BADVC Scoring Matrix

**How to Score**:

Rate each dimension on a scale:

- **High** = 3 points
- **Medium** = 2 points
- **Low** = 1 point

**Total Score Interpretation**:

- **13-15 points**: Excellent topic opportunity
- **10-12 points**: Good topic, pursue if aligned
- **7-9 points**: Marginal topic, need strategic reason
- **<7 points**: Skip or defer

**Example Scoring**:

```
Topic: "AI Content Writing Tools Comparison"

Breadth: HIGH (3) - Many tools, features, use cases
Authority: MEDIUM (2) - Some experience, need more testing
Depth: HIGH (3) - Can create comprehensive comparison
Volume: HIGH (3) - 8,900 monthly searches, trending up
Competition: MEDIUM (2) - Some good comparisons, room for better

Total: 13/15 ✅ PURSUE

Strategy: Create most comprehensive comparison with testing data
```

## Topic Cluster Strategy

### What Are Topic Clusters?

**Definition**: A content organization model where a pillar page broadly covers a topic, supported by cluster content that addresses specific aspects in depth.

**Structure**:

```
                    [Pillar Page]
                "Content Marketing Guide"
                         |
        _________________|_________________
       |                 |                 |
[Cluster Content]  [Cluster Content]  [Cluster Content]
"Content Strategy"  "Content Creation"  "Content Distribution"
       |                 |                 |
   [Sub-clusters]    [Sub-clusters]    [Sub-clusters]
```
