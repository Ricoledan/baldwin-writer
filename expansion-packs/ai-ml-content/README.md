## üöÄ Installation

### Automatic (Future)

```bash
baldwin-init init --pack ai-ml-content
```

### Manual

This pack is included with Baldwin Writer by default in the `expansion-packs/ai-ml-content/` directory. The Baldwin core agents automatically reference these files when working on AI/ML content.

## üí° Usage

### Using AI-Specific Knowledge

The AI pack provides additional context for Baldwin agents when researching and creating AI/ML content. Agents will automatically reference AI-specific examples and sources when appropriate.

### Research Workflow

When researching AI topics, the Content Strategist (Maya) can use:

```
/strategist
*research-topics

# Maya will use AI-specific research sources and methodologies
# See: ai-ml-content/data/ai-research-sources.md
```

### Validation Examples

Reference validated AI topic examples:

```
/strategist
*validate-topic

# Provide topic: "RAG architecture best practices"
# Maya references: ai-ml-content/data/ai-validation-examples.md
```

### Topic Clusters

Use pre-built AI topic clusters:

```
/strategist
*plan-series

# Select from: ai-ml-content/data/ai-topic-clusters.md
# - Prompt Engineering Mastery
# - RAG Architecture & Implementation
# - LLM Fine-tuning Guide
```
