```

### AI Competition Assessment

**Low Competition Signals**:

- Few comprehensive production guides
- Mostly academic papers (no practical guides)
- Outdated content (>6 months in fast-moving areas)
- Missing code examples
- No benchmark comparisons
- Theory-only (no production experience)

**High Competition Signals**:

- Major AI labs published guides (OpenAI, Anthropic docs)
- Multiple comprehensive tutorials (<3 months old)
- Strong code repositories with examples
- Benchmark leaderboards exist
- Active community content

**Example Assessment**:

```
Topic: "Prompt Engineering Best Practices"

Top 10 Results:
1. OpenAI docs - DA 95 (authoritative but general)
2. Anthropic prompt engineering - DA 82 (excellent but Claude-specific)
3. Learn Prompting - DA 58 (good but basic)
4-10. Various blogs - DA 40-60 (mixed quality)

Gap Analysis:
- Official docs are reference-style (not systematic guide)
- Most guides are model-specific
- No comprehensive testing framework
- Missing: Production prompt management

Verdict: MEDIUM COMPETITION - Can win with depth + framework ✅
```

## When to Pursue Emerging AI Topics

AI moves fast. Pursue emerging topics (<6 months old) when:

**Research Momentum**:

- "Constitutional AI" - New Anthropic research
  - 50+ arXiv papers in 3 months
  - Early mover advantage
  - Build authority as topic grows

**Practitioner Adoption**:

- "Function Calling" - OpenAI feature launch
  - Immediate developer interest
  - Few production guides exist
  - High search demand building

**Tool/Framework Launch**:

- "LlamaIndex" initial release
  - Growing GitHub stars (+1K/week)
  - Active community forming
  - Documentation gaps = content opportunities

**Academic to Production Shift**:

- "RLHF" (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)
  - Research → ChatGPT implementation
  - Massive interest spike
  - Production guides needed

## AI Content Consumption Patterns

AI content consumers behave differently:

**Research-First Audience**:

- Read arXiv papers before tutorials
- Want theoretical understanding + practical implementation
- High tolerance for technical depth

**Practitioner-First Audience**:

- Need working code immediately
- Want cookbook/recipe style
- Less interested in theory

**Content Strategy**:

- **Theory + Practice Combo**: Explain research + provide code
- **Progressive Depth**: Start practical, link to papers for deep dive
- **Reproducible Examples**: All code must run (broken code = lost trust)
- **Recency Matters**: Update frequently (AI changes fast)
