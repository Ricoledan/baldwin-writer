4. Medium post - DA 90 (but generic)
5-10. Weaker blogs, incomplete guides

Gap Analysis:
- Official docs are reference-style (not tutorial)
- Kong/Auth0 are vendor-focused
- No comprehensive language-agnostic guide
- Missing: Algorithm comparison + code in multiple languages

Verdict: MEDIUM COMPETITION - Can win with depth ✅
```

## When to Pursue Low-Volume Tech Topics

Not all valuable tech topics have high search volume. Pursue low-volume (<100/month) tech topics when:

**High Commercial Intent**:

- "Kubernetes cost optimization strategies" (210/month)
  - BUT: Audiences have $100K+ cloud budgets
  - High conversion value justifies low volume

**Technical Decision-Makers**:

- "Microservices migration strategy" (180/month)
  - BUT: CTOs and architects searching
  - Lead value: $50K-$500K deals

**Emerging Technologies**:

- "WebAssembly production use cases" (90/month)
- Growing trend, early mover advantage
- Build authority before mainstream

**Niche Expertise Demonstration**:

- "gRPC vs GraphQL performance" (65/month)
- Demonstrates deep expertise
- Attracts quality leads

**Community Authority Building**:

- "Elixir OTP supervision trees explained" (45/month)
- Niche but passionate community
- Builds thought leadership
